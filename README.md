## Introduction to R Markdown

I was asked to put together a 3-hour introduction on R Markdown for my colleagues at work. This repository contains all of the materials I used in that class. The main document is `IntroductiontoRMarkdown.Rmd`. There are several examples and some exercises in which people put together a simple R Markdown document.

You can see the HTML version of the main teaching material [on Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/brandonkopp/intro_to_r_markdown).

**Note:** For those looking to run the `IntroductiontoRmarkdown.Rmd` file:

-  You will need to install the following packages before you knitting this document  
    + `rmarkdown`
    + `knitr`
    + `dplyr`
    + `ggplot2` 
    + `plotly`
    + `DT`  
- This document is intended to be output to HTML. Some things may look strange if you knit to PDF or Word.
