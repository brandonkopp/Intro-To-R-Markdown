## Introduction to R Markdown

I was asked to put together a 2-hour introduction on R Markdown for my colleagues at work. This repository contains an Rmd document I made to mirror the RPres talk I gave. You can see the HTML version of this repo [on Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/brandonkopp/RMarkdown).

## Usage
Everyone if free to use the content in this talk for whatever purposes you see fit.
